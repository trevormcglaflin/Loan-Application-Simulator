This website simulates applying for a personal loan through a bank. You will fill out a form with personal information
and information about the loan you want to get. It will approve or reject your loan based on a machine learning algorithm using
python sklearn library (k nearest neighbor). If the loan is accepted it will use c++ to generate a payment schedule for the loan and 
display that table to the user.

this is hosted on a silk server, so to run the application go to this link: https://tmcglafl.w3.uvm.edu/cs120/M3OEP-MPL2-tmcglafl/

There are a bunch of python packages that i used so if it doesn't work, I apologize. I'm not really sure what needs to be 
on my computer and what needs to be on the server or if it matters.

However, here are the python packages that I used:
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- sys
- csv

I learned all of the machine learning stuff through an online class that I took through IBM EDX. 

Like I mention in my video, the cpp file was recycled from my first open ended project in this module.
