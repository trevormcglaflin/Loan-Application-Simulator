This website simulates applying for a personal loan through a bank. You will fill out a form with personal information
and information about the loan you want to get. It will approve or reject your loan based on a machine learning algorithm using
python sklearn library (k nearest neighbor). If the loan is accepted it will use c++ to generate a payment schedule for the loan and 
display that table to the user.

However, here are the python packages that I used:
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- sys
- csv

I learned all of the machine learning stuff through an online class that I took through IBM EDX. NOTE: due to some dependency issues
it will automatically accept all applications if you go to the website but watch the video for more details about the machine learning side
of it.
